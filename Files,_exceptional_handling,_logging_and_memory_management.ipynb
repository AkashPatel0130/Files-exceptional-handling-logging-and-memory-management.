        "-  Memory management is the process of allocation and deallocation of memory resources in a computer system.\n",

        "12). What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Exception handling allows you to manage and respond to errors during program execution without crashing your program.\n",

        "\n",
        "14). What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",

        "- Because files are limited resources managed by the operating system, making sure files are closed after use will protect against hard-to-debug issues like running out of file handles or experiencing corrupted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "20). What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "- The `read()` method will read the entire content of the file or stream if no argument is provided, returning a string. On the other hand, the `readline()` method reads a single line up to the newline character (`\\n`) and returns it as a string. If there are no more lines to read, it will return an empty string.\n",

        "\n",
        "23). What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "-  One of the most common causes of memory leaks in Python is the retention of objects that are no longer being used. This can occur when an object is referenced by another object, but the reference is never removed. As a result, the garbage collector is unable to deallocate the unused object, leading to a memory leak.\n",
        "\n",
        "24). How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "- To raise an exception, use the raise keyword.\n",
